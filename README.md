# Amber's React Playground
I'm learning React here in June 2017 and figuring this little baby app out as I go.

So far, we've got:
- Redux to control state
- Routing with React-Router
- A simple login using `fetch()` and an API from my work that will be useless to you - use something you can actually log into.
- A little color-picker thing with some validation and a fun gradient spinner bit.

### Shout-outs to:
- [A brilliant React / Redux / routing / auth / Firebase four-part tutorial from the people at Tighten.Co](https://blog.tighten.co/react-101-building-a-gif-search-engine)
- Pluralsight's [React.js: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents)

Occasional [blog posts from me on Medium](http://www.medium.com/@heyamberwilkie) about various things here.
